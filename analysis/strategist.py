        - Planning should start broad (aspect frames) then home in (suspicions) as evidence accumulates.
        - We do NOT encode a rigid slot ratio here – we instruct the model to maintain a sensible
          balance (e.g., ~60% aspects early, shifting to more suspicions later). This keeps logic simple
          and avoids brittle heuristics in code.
        - Each item must include a clear rationale; we ask the model to fold "why now" and
          "exit criteria" into the single 'reasoning' field, avoiding schema churn.
